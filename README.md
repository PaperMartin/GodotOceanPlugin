## Technical

Texture format: Each sky is provided as a panorama texture.

Each individual sky has a Godot scene with a World Environment node, plus a demo landscape with example lighting and fog pass for reference.

The import resolution and type of compression used on the sky textures is entirely up to you.  It should be set at a level which you feel utilises appropriate amounts of memory for your game amd platform, taking into account the amount of compression artifacts that you feel are acceptable.
