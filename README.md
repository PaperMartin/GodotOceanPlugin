# Ocean plugin

Inspired from Sea of Thieves among other things, adds a "WaterBody" node that spawns a water volume with configurable gertsner waves (up to 2 right now, 4 max later) 
Will later have buoyancies, as well as tools to set whether or not a water body should extend infinitely or only cover a set area, and "paint" the water height in the world, so that you can for example make the waves lower around islands etc.  
Currently still early in development, if anyone has any suggestions for features or for cleaner code I'll take it
